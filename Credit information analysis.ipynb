    "What Kind of Company is Home Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "Home Credit Group is a global non-bank financial institution that focuses on providing consumer finance to people with limited or no credit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "They offer services such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Point-of-sale loans\n",
    "\n",
    "Cash loans\n",
    "\n",
    "Mobile and digital financial services\n",
    "\n",
    "Their key market includes underserved populations who may not have access to traditional banking credit due to lack of formal documentation or history.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Expected in This Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition asks participants to build a machine learning model to predict a client's likelihood of repaying a loan- binary classification: default or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants are provided with:\n",
    "\n",
    "Application data (features like income, employment, credit, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical data from previous loans and behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "Related external data (bureau info, credit card balance, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict the probability of a customer defaulting on a loan, improving credit risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What Are the Benefits to Home Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Credit Scoring:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional credit scoring often excludes people without a credit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning-based model can help identify creditworthy clients among those underserved by conventional methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Risk:\n",
    "\n",
    "By better identifying risky applicants, Home Credit can reduce defaults and financial losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Reach:\n",
    "\n",
    "With better risk assessment, the company can confidently expand to new customers in emerging markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operational Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated and accurate predictions reduce the burden on manual assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitive Advantage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using state-of-the-art models makes their services faster and more reliable compared to traditional banks.\n",
